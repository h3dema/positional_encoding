# Positional encoding

This repository hsa two examples of how to use positional encoding.
- positional_encoding.ipynb
    - this notebook shows a simple (sine/cosine-based) function to create positional encoding.
- learnable_pe.ipynb
    - shows a simple learnable positional encoding class, that can be trained alongside the model.
